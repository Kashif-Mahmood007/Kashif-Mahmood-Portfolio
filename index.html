                    <b>Project Overview:</b><br>
                    To tackle the increasing challenges faced in peanut agriculture, particularly in areas such as variety classification, disease diagnosis, and pest identification, I developed a comprehensive and intelligent image classification system dedicated to peanut crop analysis. This innovative solution is designed to support farmers, agricultural researchers, and agritech platforms by providing accurate and reliable identification of peanut types, harmful pests, and plant diseases. By integrating state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and advanced image processing methods, the system aims to revolutionize traditional agricultural practices, enhance decision-making, and ultimately contribute to healthier crop management and improved yields. <br><br>

                    <b>Functional Modules:</b><br>
                    The project is strategically structured into three core modules, each addressing a specific aspect of peanut crop analysis. The Peanut Classification module focuses on identifying and categorizing different types of peanuts based on distinct visual characteristics, assisting in quality control and variety management. The Peanut Pest Identification module is designed to detect and classify various pests that pose threats to peanut crops, enabling early intervention and minimizing potential damage. Meanwhile, the Peanut Disease Detection module specializes in diagnosing common diseases in peanut plants through detailed analysis of leaf and crop imagery, supporting timely and accurate treatment decisions. <br>
                    To integrate these functionalities into a cohesive system, we utilized two publicly available datasets for the Peanut Pest Identification and Peanut Disease Detection modules. For the Peanut Classification module, we developed a custom dataset from scratch, capturing and curating images of various peanut types. <br><br>

                    <b>Advanced Deep Learning Algorithms:</b><br>
                    The core of this project is built on advanced deep learning techniques and meticulous data engineering. To achieve high accuracy across all modules, I initially employed several state-of-the-art pretrained models, including ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B0 and B4. However, these models did not consistently reach the desired accuracy threshold of beyond 98%. To overcome this, I leveraged more advanced architectures that combine convolutional neural networks with the cutting-edge transformer conceptâ€”specifically, the ConvNeXt variants (Tiny, Small, and Base). These models not only delivered state-of-the-art performance but also set a new benchmark in accuracy and robustness for peanut crop classification, pest detection, and disease identification. <br><br>

                    <b>User Interface and System Deployment:</b><br> 
                    A fully integrated web interface was developed to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, ensures a responsive and visually intuitive design that performs smoothly across all devices. On the backend, PHP and MySQL power robust user management and efficient data handling, maintaining reliability and security. To bridge the deep learning models with the platform, a custom Flask API was implemented, enabling dynamic, real-time predictions from user-uploaded images. This architecture not only guarantees fast and accurate responses but also supports scalability and future enhancements with ease. <br><br>

                    <b>Academic Impact and Recognition:</b><br>
                    A standout success of this project is the publication of three impactful research papers in prestigious, peer-reviewed international platforms: IEEE, PLOS ONE, and Sensors (MDPI). These publications not only validate the innovative methodologies and technical rigor underpinning the project but also highlight its meaningful contribution to advancing agricultural image classification technologies. This academic recognition has been a tremendous confidence booster, elevating my professional profile and inspiring me to continue driving innovation and excellence in the field.

                    <p>
                        <b>Project Overview: </b><br>
                        As part of my semester project, I designed and developed a robust Library Management System (LMS) using C++. The system is tailored to meet the practical requirements of educational institutions, offering seamless book management, user authentication, and interactive features. With a strong emphasis on usability and efficiency, the LMS caters to students, teachers, and administrative staff alike. From issuing books to tracking overdue returns and calculating fines, this solution automates and simplifies the day-to-day operations of a traditional library environment. <br><br>

                        <b>Core System Architecture:</b> <br>
                        The system is structured around four primary classes: BookInfo, IssueBook, UserInfo, and Security. The BookInfo class manages book entries, updates, deletions, and displays, while tracking the number of available copies. The IssueBook class governs book issuing protocolsâ€”allowing a 7-day borrowing period for students and 21 days for teachersâ€”and automatically calculates fines for late returns based on the number of overdue days. The UserInfo class maintains user records, and the Security class ensures access control through proper authentication mechanisms using username, password, and email. <br><br>

                        <b>User Experience & Search Capabilities: </b> <br>
                        The LMS is designed with the end-user in mind, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for all types of users. It facilitates comprehensive book searches using multiple criteria such as ISBN number, book title, author name, publisher, and publication date. Whether the user is a librarian managing inventory or a student looking for specific materials, the system ensures fast, accurate, and user-friendly interactions. <br><br>

                        <b>Security, Smoothness & Speech Integration: </b><br>
                        To protect user data and prevent unauthorized access, a robust security module has been implemented. It includes user verification through credentials and integrates barricade logic to ensure smooth transitions and controlled flow between system modules. One of the standout features of the LMS is the integration of a speech acknowledgment system. This voice output functionality allows the system to "speak" to usersâ€”offering auditory confirmations, notifications, and instructions. This not only enhances accessibility but also creates a more interactive and engaging user experience. <br><br>

                        <b>Achievements & Learning Outcomes: </b><br>
                        Developing this LMS gave me hands-on experience in applying object-oriented programming principles to solve real-world problems. It strengthened my skills in C++ programming, system design, file handling, and user interface logic. Implementing advanced features like fine calculation, voice acknowledgment, and secure user authentication taught me the importance of blending functionality with user convenience. This project stands as a complete, deployable solution and a milestone in my academic journey, demonstrating both technical depth and practical relevance. <br><br>
